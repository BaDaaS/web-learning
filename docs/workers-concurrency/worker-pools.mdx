# Worker pools

Worker pools are essential for managing concurrent tasks efficiently in web
applications, especially when working with CPU-intensive operations or
WebAssembly modules that benefit from parallel processing.

## Overview

A worker pool manages a collection of Web Workers, distributing tasks among them
to maximize CPU utilization while avoiding the overhead of creating and
destroying workers for each task.

## Implementation

<CodeExample
  path="workers-concurrency/worker-pool.example.ts"
  language="typescript"
  title="Complete Worker Pool Implementation"
  description="A robust worker pool implementation with load balancing, error handling, timeout management, and comprehensive statistics tracking."
/>

## Key Features

### 1. Load Balancing

- Automatic distribution of tasks to available workers
- Queue management for when all workers are busy
- Prevention of worker starvation

### 2. Error Handling

- Worker crash recovery with automatic replacement
- Task timeout management
- Graceful degradation when workers fail

### 3. Resource Management

- Configurable pool size based on system capabilities
- Proper cleanup and worker termination
- Memory usage monitoring

### 4. Performance Monitoring

- Task execution time tracking
- Worker utilization statistics
- Queue length monitoring

## Best Practices

1. **Size the pool appropriately** - Usually `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` or
   slightly less
2. **Handle worker failures** - Always have a recovery strategy for crashed
   workers
3. **Implement timeouts** - Prevent tasks from hanging indefinitely
4. **Monitor performance** - Track metrics to optimize pool configuration
5. **Clean up resources** - Always call `destroy()` when the pool is no longer
   needed

## Integration with WebAssembly

Worker pools are particularly effective when combined with WebAssembly modules
for CPU-intensive tasks:

```typescript
// Example worker script for WASM processing
// worker-wasm-processor.js
import init, { process_data } from './pkg/my_wasm_module.js';

let wasmInitialized = false;

self.onmessage = async function (e) {
  const { taskId, data } = e.data;

  try {
    if (!wasmInitialized) {
      await init();
      wasmInitialized = true;
    }

    const result = process_data(new Uint8Array(data));
    self.postMessage({ taskId, result: Array.from(result) });
  } catch (error) {
    self.postMessage({ taskId, error: error.message });
  }
};
```
