# Web learning overview

Welcome to the **Web Learning** documentation site - your comprehensive guide for
preparing interviewers on advanced web technologies, specifically focusing on
TypeScript SDKs, Rust/WebAssembly integration, and concurrency patterns.

## What You'll Learn

This documentation covers five critical areas for modern web development:

### TypeScript SDK & WebAssembly Integration

Learn how to design and implement TypeScript SDKs that effectively wrap
Rust/WASM modules for both Node.js and browser environments.

- API design patterns and initialization strategies
- Asset loading and bundling considerations
- Error handling and cancellation patterns
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Workers & Concurrency

Master the art of offloading heavy computational work using various concurrency
patterns and worker threads.

- MessagePort and transferable objects
- Pipeline design and backpressure handling
- Worker pool management
- Cross-origin considerations

### Rust/WASM Specifics

Understand the unique challenges and opportunities when working with Rust
compiled to WebAssembly.

- Memory management and limitations
- Rayon for parallel processing
- Error mapping between Rust and JavaScript
- Build optimization and size considerations

### Cross-Origin Security

Navigate the complex world of cross-origin policies, CORS, and security
isolation requirements.

- Same-origin policy and CORS fundamentals
- Cross-origin isolation (COOP/COEP)
- SharedArrayBuffer security requirements
- Canvas tainting and resource loading

### Full-Stack Debugging

Develop skills for debugging across the TypeScript-WASM-Runtime boundary.

- Profiling and tracing techniques
- Identifying boundary-related bugs
- Performance pathology detection
- Memory leak investigation

## How to Use This Guide

Each section includes:

- **Teaching Notes**: Concise explanations with practical examples
- **Signals of Mastery**: What good answers look like
- **Red Flags**: Common misconceptions and poor practices
- **Questions**: Probing interview questions with expected talking points
- **Exercises**: Hands-on scenarios for practical assessment

:::tip Interviewer Focus
This guide is designed specifically for **interviewers** preparing to assess
candidates' knowledge in these advanced web development areas. Each section
includes both technical content and assessment guidance.
:::

## Getting Started

1. **For Interviewers**: Start with the [Interviewer
   Rubric](/docs/rubrics/interviewer-rubric) to understand the assessment
   framework
2. **For Quick Reference**: Use the [Quick
   Cheatsheet](/docs/rubrics/quick-cheatsheet) during interviews
3. **For Deep Learning**: Work through each technical section systematically
4. **For Practice**: Try the [Exercises](/docs/exercises) to test your
   understanding

## Prerequisites

Basic familiarity with:

- TypeScript/JavaScript fundamentals
- Web APIs and browser environment
- Basic Rust concepts (helpful but not required)
- WebAssembly concepts (helpful but not required)

:::warning Advanced Content
This material assumes intermediate to advanced web development knowledge. It's
designed for senior developers and technical interviewers assessing
senior-level candidates.
